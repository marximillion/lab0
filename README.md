ENGO 551 - Adv. Topics on Geospatial Technologies

For the first lab/project, I created a brief portfolio website describing things about myself, my past work experiences, contact information, and blog updates.

The folder structure is basic with all the files being under the main src folder.

Within the src folder, there are 5 html pages namely:

- index.html
- about.html
- portfolio.html
- contact.html
- blog.html

one .css and one .scss file:

- styles.css
- styles.scss

a subfolder named "images" which contains all the .png and .jpg images used in the creation of my websire

Currently, my web development skills are pretty minimal, therefore the styling on the pages are subpar to my standard, however as the course progresses it is my goal to improve web design and UI/UX of my website. Additionally the integration of the .scss to .css is low-level
